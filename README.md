Clear Finance uses a Firebase-first, serverless architecture with a React + TypeScript single-page frontend. Structured financial data is stored in Firestore and visualized deterministically through charts, while Google Gemini (Vertex AI) is used only for qualitative financial explanations. The system prioritizes simplicity, low operational overhead, and clear separation between numeric certainty and AI interpretation.
